ONE TIME PAD CRACKER

Quick reference:

Text editing in this program supports basic emacs-like hotkeys.
Practically, you can paste in text and press C-g when you are done.
q-quit
c-input a cipher text 
k-input a (partial) key
b-input a crib to test

When a crib is active:
f-move the crib left in the plaintext
g-move the crib right in the plaintext
1-test the crib against the previous cipher
2-test the crib against the next cipher
a-edit the partial key to reflect the crib in its current position

The idea behind a one-time pad is that it is used one time.
If this principle is violated, that introduces major vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities can be exploited using a tool such as this one.
The idea behind this is that you can drag a crib through both cipher 
texts, and if at any position it produces English in the other cipher
text, you will have then found the correct key for those letters in each.

Full hotkeys for text entry:

Control-A 	Go to left edge of window.
Control-B 	Cursor left, wrapping to previous line if appropriate.
Control-D 	Delete character under cursor.
Control-E 	Go to right edge (stripspaces off) or end of line (stripspaces on).
Control-F 	Cursor right, wrapping to next line when appropriate.
Control-G 	Terminate, returning the window contents.
Control-H 	Delete character backward.
Control-J 	Terminate if the window is 1 line, otherwise insert newline.
Control-K 	If line is blank, delete it, otherwise clear to end of line.
Control-L 	Refresh screen.
Control-N 	Cursor down; move down one line.
Control-O 	Insert a blank line at cursor location.
Control-P 	Cursor up; move up one line.
